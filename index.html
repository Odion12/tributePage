            wildearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones
            have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man

            for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own
            Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than
            before it was. But i wil dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and

            <h2>so sad</h2>
            As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences
            from my MacBook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture
            that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy
            to his family and friends. Tracy

            <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
            What impact has Steve Jobs had on my ite? Every short story Ive
            wnitten as an adult (and certainly every one that has been
            published), almost avery email Ive ever written, has been witten on
            machines created by Apple - interacted online using an Apple machine
            long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize
            the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid And through his vision, I
            have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks
            for all your amazing work. Janna from Seattic. WA
